FACEBOOK HOMEPAGE AND PROFILE PAGE CLONE (SOCIALBOOK) PROJECT

This is a major project for me as a junior front-end Engineer. 
Doing this project really enlightened me, thereby helping me to know how to use HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT to design a website, make it responsive and interactive.
Some of the things I learnt From this project are: 
*        How to change the screen mode from light to dark.
*        How to design a sticky navigation bar.
*        How to define my design structure, layout and style, responsive and interactive.
*        E.T.C.....

I was able to carryout this project through the video tutorial of @Greatstack (Easy Tutorial) on Youtube.
